Red Light Camera Analysis
========
The code here is for a Shiny App that allows you to visualize and analyze Chicago's red light cameras. The site can be found at <a href="https://miningchi2.shinyapps.io/redlight/" target=" blank">MiningChi.com</a>.

The current functionality allows you to see data on accidents that occurred within a 100 feet of a red light camera or speed camera between 2009 to 2012.  The ticket data includes tickets from 2007 to March 2014. Ticket data does not exist for all intersections.  The analysis is automated with over 300 intersections, so please let us know if something doesnâ€™t look right.

All the data and and code for this site are all freely available. This site is just one of many related <a href="http://www.MiningChi.com" target=" blank">MiningChi</a> projects on data visualization and statistics.
